                                    The Chooser chooses between taking money from an L box that contains $5.00 and
                                    an R box that has a random amount of money (between $0.00 and $10.00).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If the Chooser chooses the L box, there is a 50% chance of the period continuing
                                    to the offer phase. If the chooser chooses the R box, there is a 25% chance of the
                                    period continuing to the offer phase.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the offer phase, the Offeror can make an offer between $0.00 and $5.00. If the
                                    Chooser accepts, the Offeror gains this money and the chooser loses this money.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If the Chooser rejects the offer, there is a resolution phase where both the Chooser
                                    and Offeror pay a $1.00 up-front cost. A Chooser who chose the L box has a 50%
                                    chance of losing an additional $4.00. A Chooser who chose the R box has a 25%
                                    chance of losing an additional $4.00. If the Chooser loses this additional $4.00, the
                                    Offeror gains an additional $4.00.
                                </li>

                                    You will be paid for one random period of the experiment (including the initial
                                    $5.00), for your answers to the five comprehension questions, and for the show-up
                                    fee.
