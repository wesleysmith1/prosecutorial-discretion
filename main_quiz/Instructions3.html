        The period consists of up to three phases. The first phase is the <b>choosing phase</b>. In
        the choosing phase, the Chooser chooses between taking money from one of two boxes:
        (i) the left (“L”) box and (ii) the right (“R”) box. The L box always contains {{Constants.v}}. The
        R box contains a random amount of money between $0.00 and {cu(Constants.w_upperbar)}. Each amount of
        money between $0.00 and {cu(Constants.w_upperbar)} is equally likely to be in the R box. Only the Chooser
        will be told the amount of money in the R box; the Chooser will be told the amount of
        money in the R box before making a decision.

        If the Chooser takes money from the L box, the period has a 50% probability of continuing 
        to the second phase. If the Chooser takes money from the R box, the period has a
        25% chance of continuing to second phase. It is as if a four-sided die (numbered 1 through
        4) is rolled after the Chooser chooses a box. If the Chooser takes money from the L box,
        the period will continue if the die lands on the number 1 or 2; otherwise, the period ends.
        If the Chooser takes money from the R box, the period will continue if the die lands on
        the number 1; otherwise, the period ends. If the period ends here, the Chooser’s earnings
        for the period would be equal to the contents of their chosen box. The Offeror’s earnings
        for the period would be $0.00.
