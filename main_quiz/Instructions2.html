    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
        In this experiment, you will initially receive $5.00 (in addition to the show-up fee). There
        are 40 periods in this experiment. In each period, you will be in one of two roles: (i) the
        Chooser or (ii) the Offeror. The role that you are initially assigned to will be your role
        throughout the experiment. Half of the subjects in the session are Choosers and half are
        Offerors. In each period, a Chooser and an Offeror will be randomly paired.
