    <h4>
        Summary
    </h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The Chooser chooses between taking money from an L box that contains $5.00 and
            an R box that has a random amount of money (between $0.00 and $10.00).
        </li>
        <li>
            If the Chooser chooses the L box, there is a 50% chance of the period continuing
            to the offer phase. If the chooser chooses the R box, there is a 25% chance of the
            period continuing to the offer phase.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the offer phase, the Offeror can make an offer between $0.00 and $5.00. If the
            Chooser accepts, the Offeror gains this money and the chooser loses this money.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the Chooser rejects the offer, there is a resolution phase where both the Chooser
            and Offeror pay a $1.00 up-front cost. A Chooser who chose the L box has a 50%
            chance of losing an additional $4.00. A Chooser who chose the R box has a 25%
            chance of losing an additional $4.00. If the Chooser loses this additional $4.00, the
            Offeror gains an additional $4.00.
        </li>
        <li>
            You will be paid for one random period of the experiment (including the initial
            $5.00), for your answers to the five comprehension questions, and for the show-up
            fee.
        </li>
