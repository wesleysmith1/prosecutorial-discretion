        This experiment is a study of economic decision making. Everyone here will earn at least
        $7.00 (the show-up fee). The amount of additional money that you earn depends partly
        on the decisions that you make and thus you should read these instructions carefully. The
        money that you earn will be paid privately to you, in cash, at the end of the experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the start of the experiment, you can earn $2.50 by answering five comprehension questions about these instructions. 
        For each correct answer to a question you will earn $0.50.
        You can refer to these written instructions as you answer the questions.
