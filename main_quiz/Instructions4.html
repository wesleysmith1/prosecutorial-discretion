    <p>
        If the period continues from the choosing phase, then the period reaches the second phase,
        which is the <b>offer phase</b>. In the offer phase, the Offeror makes an offer to the Chooser.
        The Offeror can make any offer between {{Constants.b_lowerbar}} and $5.00. If the Chooser accepts the offer,
        the Chooser loses that amount of money and the Offeror gains that amount of money.
        For example, if the Chooser accepts an offer of $4.00, she loses $4.00 and the Offeror
        gains $4.00. The period ends if the offer is accepted; the period continues to the third
        phase if the Chooser rejects the offer. If the period ends here, the Chooser’s earnings for
        the period would be equal to the contents of their chosen box minus the accepted offer.
        The Offeror’s earnings would be equal to the accepted offer.
