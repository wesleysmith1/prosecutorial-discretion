    <p>
        If the offer is rejected, the period continues to the final phase, which is the resolution
        phase. Neither the Chooser nor the Offeror makes a decision in this phase. In the resolution 
        phase, the Chooser and Offeror each lose $1.00. If the Chooser took from the L
        box, she has a 50% chance of losing an additional $4.00 and a 50% chance of losing no
        additional money. If the Chooser took from the R box, she has a 25% chance of losing
        an additional $4.00 and a 75% chance of losing no additional money. If the Chooser loses
        this additional $4.00, the Offeror gains an additional $4.00. It is as if a new four-sided
        die (numbered 1 through 4) is rolled in the resolution phase. If the Chooser took from
        the L box, she will lose an additional $4.00 if the die lands on the number 1 or 2. If the
        Chooser took from the R box, she will lose an additional $4.00 if the die lands on the
        number 1. Notice that the outcome of this die roll is separate from the previous die roll
        that determined whether the period continued to the offer phase. If the period ends here,
        the Chooser’s earnings for the period would be equal to the contents of their chosen box
        minus $1.00 and any additional loss. The Offeror’s earnings would be equal to negative
        $1.00 plus any additional gain.

        One period in this experiment will be chosen for payment for everyone in the session.
        You will be paid for this random period of the experiment (including the initial $5.00),
        for your answers to the comprehension questions, and for your show-up fee. If you lost
        money in this period, this money will be subtracted from the other experiment earnings.
        When a period ends, you will be informed of your earnings from that period and how it
        was derived.
